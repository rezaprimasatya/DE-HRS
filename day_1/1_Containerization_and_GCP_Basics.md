# Week 1: Containerization, Infrastructure, and Workflow Orchestration

## Objectives:
- Rapidly onboard with containerization, Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and workflow orchestration.
- Gain proficiency in GCP, Docker, Terraform, and basic orchestration with Airflow.

## Containerization and GCP Basics

### Containerization
Containerization is a lightweight, efficient form of virtualization that allows you to package applications and their dependencies into a single container image. This ensures that the application runs consistently across different computing environments. 

Key Concepts:
- **Containers:** Encapsulate an application's code, libraries, and dependencies, in contrast to virtual machines that include an entire operating system.
- **Docker:** The most popular platform for developing, shipping, and running containers. It uses Dockerfiles to automate the deployment of applications in lightweight, portable containers.
- **Dockerfile:** A text document that contains all the commands a user could call on the command line to assemble an image. 
- **Images:** Read-only templates used to build containers. They are built from Dockerfiles and stored in a registry.
- **Docker Compose:** A tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. With a single command, you can create and start all the services defined in a `docker-compose.yml` file.

### Google Cloud Platform (GCP)
Google Cloud Platform is a suite of cloud computing services that runs on the same infrastructure that Google uses internally for its end-user products, such as Google Search, Gmail, file storage, and YouTube. GCP offers a broad range of services covering compute, storage, networking, big data, machine learning, and the internet of things (IoT), as well as cloud management, security, and developer tools.

Key Services:
- **Compute Engine:** Scalable, high-performance virtual machines (VMs).
- **Cloud Storage:** Object storage with global edge-caching for fast data access.
- **BigQuery:** Fully-managed, serverless data warehouse for scalable, cost-efficient data analysis.
- **Cloud Functions:** Event-driven serverless compute platform.
- **Cloud Composer:** Managed workflow orchestration service built on Apache Airflow.

Relevance in Data Engineering:
Containerization and GCP form the backbone of modern data engineering infrastructure. Containers provide a consistent and isolated environment for developing, testing, and deploying applications, which is crucial for data pipelines that may have complex dependencies. GCP offers scalable and managed services that can handle vast amounts of data and complex computations, enabling data engineers to focus on insights rather than infrastructure. Using these technologies together allows data engineers to build, deploy, and manage data workflows efficiently, enabling rapid development and deployment of scalable data processing and analytics solutions.
