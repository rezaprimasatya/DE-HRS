To create an advanced, complex, and comprehensive guide for setting up Apache Airflow both locally with Docker and in the cloud with Google Cloud Composer using Terraform, we will delve into more detailed configurations, including security enhancements, custom plugins, and dependencies management. This guide assumes familiarity with Docker, Terraform, and Google Cloud Platform.

## Advanced Setup of Airflow Locally with Docker

### 1. Custom Airflow Image

To handle complex dependencies and customizations, you'll often need to build a custom Docker image for Airflow.

- **Dockerfile**:

```Dockerfile
FROM apache/airflow:2.1.4
USER root
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y --no-install-recommends \
        build-essential \
        libpq-dev \
    && apt-get clean \
    && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
USER airflow
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt
```

- **requirements.txt**: Include your Python dependencies here, such as pandas, numpy, or any custom libraries you need for your data processing tasks.

### 2. Enhanced Docker Compose Setup

For a more complex setup, you might integrate additional services like Redis or PostgreSQL as backends for Airflow. Hereâ€™s an example snippet from a `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  postgres:
    image: postgres:13
    environment:
      POSTGRES_USER: airflow
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: airflow
      POSTGRES_DB: airflow
    ports:
      - "5432:5432"
  redis:
    image: 'redis:latest'
    ports:
      - "6379:6379"
  webserver:
    build: .
    depends_on:
      - postgres
      - redis
    environment:
      - LOAD_EXAMPLES=no
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    volumes:
      - ./dags:/opt/airflow/dags
      - ./plugins:/opt/airflow/plugins
    command: webserver
  scheduler:
    build: .
    depends_on:
      - webserver
    volumes:
      - ./dags:/opt/airflow/dags
      - ./plugins:/opt/airflow/plugins
    command: scheduler
```

### 3. Security Considerations

- **Environment Variables**: Use environment variables for sensitive information and configure these in `docker-compose.yml`.
- **Networks**: Define custom networks in Docker Compose to isolate components if necessary.

## Advanced Google Cloud Composer Setup with Terraform

### 1. Terraform Configuration for Cloud Composer

In a more advanced setup, you would customize the Cloud Composer environment to fit specific needs, such as specifying the location of DAGs in Cloud Storage and configuring environment variables.

- **main.tf**:

```terraform
provider "google" {
  credentials = file("path/to/your-credentials-file.json")
  project     = "your-gcp-project-id"
  region      = "us-central1"
}

resource "google_composer_environment" "airflow" {
  name   = "advanced-airflow-environment"
  region = "us-central1"

  config {
    node_count = 3

    node_config {
      zone         = "us-central1-a"
      machine_type = "n1-standard-1"
      network      = google_compute_network.custom_network.id
      subnetwork   = google_compute_subnetwork.custom_subnetwork.id
    }

    software_config {
      airflow_version = "2.1.4"
      python_version  = "3"
      env_variables = {
        AIRFLOW_VAR_MY_VARIABLE = "some-value"
      }
    }

    database_config {
      machine_type = "db-n1-standard-2"
    }

    web_server_config {
      machine_type = "composer-n1-webserver-2"
    }

    encryption_config {
      kms_key_name = google_kms_crypto_key.airflow_crypto_key.id
    }
  }
}

# Define other resources like google_compute_network, google_compute_subnetwork, and google_kms_crypto_key as needed
```

### 2. Scalability and High Availability

In complex environments, scalability and high availability become critical. Google Cloud Composer's managed service abstracts most of the scalability concerns, but you should configure the environment for high availability according to your organization's needs.

### 3. Security and Compliance

- **Identity and Access Management (IAM)**: Ensure that the service account used by Cloud Composer has the minimum necessary permissions.
- **Data Encryption**: Utilize Google Cloud's Key Management Service (KMS) for encryption keys management and ensure all data at rest and in transit is encrypted.
- **Networking**: Configure VPC Service Controls and Private IP for Cloud Composer to enhance network security and minimize exposure to the public internet.

### Precautions and Best Practices

- **Cost Management**: Regularly monitor your GCP billing dashboard and set up budget alerts

.
- **Configuration Drift**: Use Terraform to manage all changes to your infrastructure to avoid configuration drift.
- **Dependency Management**: Regularly update your Docker images and Terraform configurations to leverage the latest features and security patches.

This guide provides a starting point for advanced Airflow setups using Docker for local development and Google Cloud Composer for cloud-based workflow orchestration, emphasizing custom configurations, security, and best practices for scalability and high availability.
